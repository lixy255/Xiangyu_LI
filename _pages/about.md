I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 

My research interests encompass minimalist syntax, Chinese syntax, and syntax-pragmatics interface in sign language.

I am pursing an understanding of the innate biological component of the language faculty (or say, domain-specific properties of language competence) from different approaches.

**Language**: Mandarin Chinese (native); Hakka (proficient); Cantonese (proficient); Hong Kong Sign Language (fluent)
